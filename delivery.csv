The only one that seemed to me a good person was the one who sacrificed her private life to take care of the THREE children of another couple. And I felt sorry for her.

I'm a stick in the mud for keeping things the same when it works, just because something is new doesn't mean its better. I REFUSE to watch the new cast, its just a ripoff of the real show.

Trademark Properties has a professional human touch that made the business interesting and entertaining at the same time. No scripting, no high jinks, no crap. The original crew had the ingredients that make a good show- GREAT.

A&E dropped the ball when they made the change. If I was an A&E Chairman, I would first apologize to all the viewers for such a grave mistake. Then I would fire all the producers and anyone associated with changing the show.

This show is amazing because it's partly scripted and partly improvised.

The chemistry between the characters is fun to watch, and as the show goes on the actors start getting more comfortable with one another. Each member brings their unique skill to the team. It's also nice to see that the two women (Min-young and Se-Jeong) on the team carry them through many challenges and puzzles using their smarts and bravery while the men stand on the sidelines. And both of them get their hands dirty to make sure that they get results. Jae-suk leads the team and makes sure that they are on task. Lee Kwang-soo and Jong-Min are the comedic relief but also somehow will solve a solution once in a while that has the team stumped though usually, they do not contribute much to the solving of crimes. Sehun's competitiveness comes out super charming and infectious. He tends to be quiet, but two things seem to get him out of his shell: competition Ans Lee Seung-gi. He's the most mature of this group and the most helpful. You can tell that there are times that he does not want to do something or might be a bit scared, but when he sees that no one else will do the task, he steps up and willingly completes it (He is my favorite character on this show). Detective Ahn is the serious and quiet type and helps them keep things on track. And the new addition, Lee Seung-gi, brings athletics into the group but tends to be a bit more carefree and fun.

The mysteries on the show are like escape room-type puzzles, and some of them are in Korean or Chinese, so they can be difficult to follow while others, can be solved. Most of the mysteries or crimes on the show seem like they are just for that one episode, but in the end, they tie them all together.

The first season's plot was not great. Some of the storylines did not make sense, and you could tell they tried hard to make everything connect. The things that kept me watching were the characters and the challenges that they completed. But the second and third season was amazing. There was a clear plot and mystery solved in the last episode though the ending felt open-ended. Though some episodes were not part of the overall story, there were still elements that connected to a larger plot. This season seemed like a whodunit, and there were clues sprinkled throughout the whole season helping you solve the case. I did not figure out who it was until five seconds before the reveal (not sure that counts) but looking back, there were more than enough clues as to who the killer was from the first episode.

Overall, would highly recommend this show. It's a fun watch that's lighthearted even with all the murder going on you are just detached from it because it looks so fake.""",Busted!: کارآگاهان آماتور درگیر حل معماها و جرائم می‌شوند، تلاش می‌کنند تا رازهای پنهان را کشف کنند و مجرمان را به دام بیاندازند.

I am not referring to the fact that one of the hosts is a woman, but rather that one of the hosts is a ordinary person, who just happens to be a woman.

Although I consider myself a bit of an outdoorsman, I find that out of all the different people making shows of this sort, it is Ruth Hawke that I can relate to the most. That she has a hard time with different aspects of each episode really does give viewers a much more realistic idea of what it would be like to be in the same situation. Whether anyone wants to admit it or not, the vast majority of us would be a lot more like her if we were lost in the wilds than we would be like her husband or Bear Grylls.

As for her husband, Mykel Hawkes is a military trained survival expert. His personality is what you would expect from a someone with this background and his disposition can be somewhat rigid. But the interaction he has with his wife definitely improves it and together they can even be funny at times. And he does know his stuff pretty well.

Overall, the show fits into the same category as others like Man versus Wild and Dual Survival. All of these are staged at points (as mentioned in the disclaimer before each episode) and are not real survival like Survivorman. Regardless, it is still educational and very entertaining.","Man, Woman, Wild: زوجی متشکل از یک زن و شوهر در مکان‌های بکر و وحشی زنده می‌مانند و مهارت‌های بقا و همکاری خود را به نمایش می‌گذارند."

There are now 3 series a year - ordinary Joe, celeb and professional - as well as Christmas specials. It's no wonder that people are starting to get a bit tired of it. Since they never tell you the ratings these days I infer this fact, besides my own feelings, from the format tweaks this year and the fact it has been moved back down from 9pm to 8pm. Inexplicably, BBC producers seem to have got the idea that the way to revive their ageing cookery contests is to have irritating, unqualified people sticking their oar in. In Great British Menu it's the excruciating Andi Oliver, now in Masterchef you have one lot of contestants looking on and cheering another lot. Yay!

There's nothing much wrong with the show, and certainly not the presenters: they're the ones who have made it a massive success with spin-offs in Australia and the US. They're personable, and have the unusual but crucial skill of being able to describe a dish in a few words, in such a way that the viewer can imagine what it's like to eat. Much as I love Gordon Ramsay he, for example, cannot do that.

It's simply that too much has been asked of the show. In the BBC's dearth of new prime-time ideas, it has been promoted above its level. What is needed is not little faffy tweaks, but for us all to have a bit of a break from it.

It's definitely cool to see such brilliant minds at work in Canada.

There have been numerous seasons so far, and the Dragons come and go, usually staying for a couple seasons, while some veteran Dragons have stayed there for almost the entire series (like Jim Treliving and Arlene Dickinson). I find that switching up the Dragons is a good idea, because it gives a sense that Canada has many successful entrepreneurs, and you get to meet new people as well.

However, what I like most about this show is the entrepreneurs and their pitches. Some are just horrible, and some are just brilliant. It's shocking how sometimes, the simplest ideas are the best ones, and it's great to see how more and more ideas come out each season.

Unfortunately, there is one thing that I am not enjoying about the show. The Dragons can sometimes be excessively rude and inappropriate, and it seems like the longer a Dragon has stayed inside the Den, the more comfortable they are with this behaviour. This is national television, and I think that if an idea is terrible, you still shouldn't chew out the entrepreneur in front of the nation like that. It's a matter of respect and dignity.

345.0,346. FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman,2006–2010,"7.3
 (1.1K)","Kids compete in challenges in this game show, hosted by an animated dog.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496195/?ref_=sr_t_346,30m,"Animation,Comedy,Family",George Goodchild,5.0,100.0,"FETCH! With Ruff Ruffman is an educational reality game show in which an animated orange dog sends six real kids off on challenges. Now, I know what you're thinking - many people like this show, but at least to me, it has a few problems. Here they are!:

1. The contestants - Every kid on this show talks, looks, acts, and dresses alike - don't even get me started on Bridget, Noel, and Talia! In some episodes of the series, the FETCHers tell Ruff what they like and that everyone else should like them too. VERY bad lesson to teach kids!

2. The challenges - When Ruff has a problem, he turns to the FETCHers and has THEM solve it. Did I mention the fact that these problems cannot be solved inside Studio G? No - the kids have to go to faraway places in order to help Ruff. Some of his challenges make no sense too, partially due to the fact that Ruff, Blossom etc are animated while the FETCHers are live-action - Ruff fears he'll have to live in the wild, so he encourages the FETCHers to go camping. In another, a bunch of sheep come into the doghouse and Ruff encourages the FETCHers to herd a flock. Too bizarre, huh?

3. Too frightening - FETCH! Is supposed to be a kids' show, but it contains too many things that horrify kids to the point where they don't want to watch the show anymore. There were two episodes in which the kids go inside haunted houses, which are mostly frightening especially for young children, and another in which the kids go to New Orleans, where one of them is eaten alive by an alligator, and Chernobyl, in which they get chased in the dark by hybrid animals.

4. Ruff is the leader of the pack - On most children's shows STARRING kids, they're free and can do whatever they want. However, on FETCH!, there's one centric character - Ruff Ruffman himself. As mentioned earlier, they are forced to do what he does and stick around waiting to do what he wants to do. These kids must be tired by now!

5. Too fast-paced - FETCH! With Ruff Ruffman was clearly the Bill Nye the Science Guy of its era - according to DannyBoy TV, it was estimated once that Bill was the fastest-paced children's show on television, and I believe FETCH! (mainly the animated segments) was just that. Many of the portions featuring Ruff, Blossom, Chet, and the former's relatives are too quick and, once the (viewing) children understand what's going on, it's over and the next scene is almost done. Geez - fast-paced shows encourage too many children (especially autistic ones (like myself)) to be overstimulated!

6. Too lazy, especially when it comes to production - From what I've heard, when the Studio G segments were being taped, Jim Conroy (Ruff's voice actor) put on stick puppet shows for the FETCHers to watch, and commented on the kids' challenges in New York. Oh, and did I mention that he voices EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER on the show except for Blossom and Chet? Not to mention that some of the challenges are also pretty lazy - as one reviewer said, one group of kids had to get the remote which controlled a toy boat with a clue in it on across a pool from the kids. The remote was in a basket floating in the pool, so, instead of just swimming to the remote and grabbing it, they had to construct a long pole which they used to slide under a section of the remote to pick it up. BALONEY!

7. Encouraging obesity - Yes, you heard me right, this show is encouraging children to get fat, as the kids on this show barely eat anything other than pizza and ice cream, despite some challenges involving health food. Now, I eat A LOT of junk, but not once in my life have I gotten overweight, and, as a children's television historian, kids deserve better than this - they need to eat FRUIT and VEGETABLES to give them a fresh start.

Now, WGBH Boston clearly cared about kids through the other shows that they produced, such as Arthur, Between the Lions, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, and especially FETCH!'s predecessor ZOOM. What do these shows (aside from Ruff's) have in common? They're all very educational for children and can stick with people even as they grow into adulthood. FETCH! Should've been like this, though they should've fixed what was wrong and BOOM! - we've got an enjoyable children's show (it would've been better without the animated segments IMO).

In short, if you want your kids to have bright, smart futures, do them a big favor and SKIP THIS SHOW! Turn on ZOOM instead!",FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman: کودکان در چالش‌های علمی، هنری و فیزیکی شرکت می‌کنند و با راف رافمن، شخصیت کارتونی برنامه، همکاری می‌کنند.
346.0,347. Special Forces: World's Toughest Test,2023–,"7.1
 (1.1K)","16 celebrity contestants battle through a set of emulated special forces training challenges, they are removed from society and the staff sergeants control everything within the camp.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22003362/?ref_=sr_t_347,1h,Reality-TV,"Mark Billingham,Jason Fox,Rudy Reyes",3.0,19.0,"Something has always fascinated me about training tier-one units such as Delta Force and the SAS. Beyond just the intensity of the exercises, there is something that exposes the grit, determination, and inner character of the people willing to put themselves through treacherous conditions to become part of a tight-knit, war-fighting team.

This isn't the first time American media has dipped its toes into reality-based television wrapped in a military training package. Shows like ""Combat Missions (2002)"", ""American Grit (2016)"", and ""The Selection: Special Operations Experiment (2016)"" are American-produced programs that have featured a fusion of reality and competition TV. ""Special Forces: World's Toughest Test"" is similar to ""The Selection,"" where a cadre of former commandos agonizes - I mean, trains - a small squad of masochistic candidates.

What many people will notice is that ""Special Forces"" is a derivative of the UK-produced ""SAS: Who Dares Wins (2015)"". The formula and training environment directly pick up where the seventh season of that program left off, except this time, we are bearing witness to a troop of willing individuals with a bit more star power than someone plucked from their home and dropped into a production environment. Many of these contestants (and the cadre) have their own followings and fan bases, which is an immediate plus for viewer numbers. It also helps that (most of them) are charismatic, have a history of being in the public eye, and bring their own baggage to the training ground.

The editing is driven by a need to create drama among the contestants. I do not doubt that the show is presented non-linearly (from Day 1 to Day 10), with the need for the post-production team to put an early focus on those contestants struggling, dominating, and/or having emotional reactions to the environment they are subjected to.

What I enjoy most about these sorts of shows is that we quickly find that physical dominance does not necessarily make a contestant a top contender. Those with solid minds and grit will rise to the top. However, a bad attitude and a lack of military bearing can keep an individual from passing the course, even if they pass all the challenges.

The training exercises and stunts remind me of ""Fear Factor,"" except with an apparent military influence. It's fantastic to see the cadre demonstrate the activity, proving that they can perform. Water is the great equalizer, so I expect many more challenges to involve water.

This show is highly entertaining, especially for those who enjoy military-oriented shows like those mentioned above. The curated drama is an unfortunate side-effect of a fascinating look into the once-hidden world of special forces selection, but this doesn't keep the show from being unwatchable. Bringing in contestants with some popularity allows an otherwise ignorant audience to become engaged with them and their adventure.

Whilst this pointless ""reality"" TV show has generally glowing reviews, and a good overall IMDb rating, I find it frustrating and annoying. This is another of those unnecessary and febrile shows that the television world is inflicting on the increasing dumbed-down population.

There are many things which annoy me about this show, apart from its shear pointlessness - one of the most annoying is the children. Both of them are spoilt brats, and the parents seem to have no idea that they are raising self-entitled monsters. Where is the common sense in letting the brats get away with what they do get away with? Who benefits from unleashing on an unsuspecting world two more ""Little Emperors""?
