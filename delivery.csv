Take two crazy special effects guys and let them take the urban myths to the ultimate test. In each episode Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage test different myths to see if their actually true or just made up.

The two hosts are just perfect. They do a great job in making the whole thing crazy and funny. You feel like you get to know them. That is a good thing as it then gets more personal. The show is well directed and well written. The cinematography I think is cool. You see booms and cameras in the picture all the time, but that gives credibility to the show. It gives the impression that they're focusing at documenting the experiments and not on the look of the show. I like that kind of ""rough"" and incidental look of the show. When I say it's well written I mean well written. It's not coincidence where they go to get the stuff they need and so on, but they made it seem like it is. It's things like this that gives this show a nice down to earth feel. The fact that the two host obviously have a lot of fun when putting the myths to the test also reflect on the show and it makes you interested and makes you pay attention. If you start watching time flies. They also does a good job in letting us know what the experts think of the myth. This makes it all the more interesting as they will have to prove them wrong or right too.

Mythbusters is a show I can recommend. It's funny, it's intelligent and it's educational. It's science made cool.","流量异常, 请尝试更换网络环境, 如果你觉得ip被误封了, 可尝试邮件联系我们, 当前ip:3.28.127.173"

Can they put this on DVD please ? – The Logo site keeps buffering with the same damn commercials (I like the Orbitz commercial tho w/Carmen, Manila and Shangela, tho). They must include the Untucked episodes on the DVD.

It's funny how so many people take this reality show contest sooo seriously – I mean the winner is crowned to a live audience of 3 people, and the host of the Grand Finale in the Untucked episode is eating fried chicken out of a bucket (that's why I love this show) It's so campy and yet so glamorous.

I'm so addicted – I can name every queen of every season, and since I'm sick and can't do anything but stare in front of a computer, I'll critique them all

(Season 1 – The Originators) Bebe Zahara Benet – If Snatch Game were in Season 1, she'd nail Oprah / Nina Flowers – The fiercest androgynous look ever / Rebecca Glasscock - The 1st pretty girl of RPDR / Shannel - The prettiest ""real"" eyes / Ongina - The prettiest bald queen / Jade - At times, prettier than Rebecca / Akashia - Worst runway walk ever / Tammie Brown - Kinda spooky look / Victoria ""Pork Chop"" Parker - First big girl to go, will make the trivia list

(Season 2) Tyra Sanchez – Straight women would've gone for him, he's a pretty boy / Raven - A macho pretty boy / Jujubee - She's Got Personality, lots of it / Tatianna - Prettier than Rebecca / Pandorra Box - Looks more like Kathy Griffin than Kathy Griffin / Jessica Wild - Miss Popularity / Sahara Davenport - Miss Ballet Moves / Morgan McMichaels - Miss Rebel / Sonique - Miss Acrobat / Mystique Summers Madison - Miss Splits / Nicole Paige Brooks - Reminded me of Julia Roberts, yes Julia Roberts / Shangela - (Seasons 2 & 3) I like and dislike her cause she's got lots of talent but her character on the show reminded me of someone really ""shady""

(Season 3 – I like this season best thus far, simply because of the variety of contestants)

Raja – The fiercest ever runway walk / Manila Luzon - A glamorous camp queen / Alexis Mateo - Competitive, deserved top 3 / Yara Sofia – Wish she were in top 3, likable personality, but what's up with the freaky contact lenses / Carmen Carrera – The pretty girl of season 3, pulls off the female illusion the best / Delta Work - The prettiest of the big girls / Mariah Paris Balenciaga – Perhaps the most beautiful of all 3 seasons queens / Stacy Layne Bryant Matthews, etc. etc. - Already looks like a woman / Indiah Ferrah - She's got $600 boobs and she's gonna wear them / Mimi Imfurst – Aptly named / Phoenix - 2 episodes is not enough to pass judgment / Venus D-Lite - Madonna lives

The Judges: who cares? The Pitt Crew: Nice touch, Ru.

I hope Season 4 is just as enjoyable as Season 3. Can't wait for the next generation of Hoogers.","流量异常, 请尝试更换网络环境, 如果你觉得ip被误封了, 可尝试邮件联系我们, 当前ip:3.28.127.173"

8,9. Hell's Kitchen,2005–,"7.2
 (23K)","World renowned chef Gordon Ramsay puts aspiring young chefs through rigorous cooking challenges and dinner services at his restaurant in Hollywood, ""Hell's Kitchen"".",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437005/?ref_=sr_t_9,42m,"Game-Show,Reality-TV","Gordon Ramsay,Jean Philippe Susilovic,Scott Leibfried",24.0,345.0,"Network: Fox; Genre: Reality, Game; Content Rating: TV-14 (strong language, mostly edited); Perspective: Contemporary (star range: 1 - 4);

Seasons Reviewed: Season 3

Had this been written about season one of ""Hell's Kitchen"" it would have been a completely different review. Still reeling from the reality series hostile takeover, I was un-amused by British tornado Chef Gordon Ramsey's blood-vessel bursting tantrums over food and sadistic treatment of his would-be chefs. A treatment that was a perfect metaphor for the way Fox was abusing it's own viewers.

But flash-forward to season 3 and Chef Gordon Ramsey and his team of inept contestants have grown on me. ""Hell's Kitchen"" is every bit a reality show and all that that implies. You've seen it before, but this time in a kitchen. Teams of chefs  divided by gender ""Apprentice""-style  live in suites by night and compete in cooking tasks by day. Tasks like designing their own menu, cooking for an elementary school, turning traditional dishes into cuisine or blind taste tests of their palette. Each time a team looses, people are picked to eliminate and Ramsey picks one to be kicked off. And yes, like any reality/competition the most talented contestants are kicked off for something insignificant so that the most interesting personalities can be standing in the final rounds. No doubt, Ramsey is just as shrew about audience interest as Simon Cowell.

But there is a fiendishly entertaining bent to ""Kitchen"" that only Gordon Ramsey can deliver. A sadism to the high school reminiscent eliminations that is only bubbling cynically under the surface of other reality shows. When Ramsey eliminates people he tells them to ""f*** off"" then smacks their chef's jacket on a meat hook with a Leatherface-like zeal. It's hard to deny how entertaining it is watching Ramsey scream obscenities at the more inept contestants, shoving food in their face and putting together a string of expletives involving Risotto and Wellington so creative it demands an uncensored DVD release. The show does say a few things about the love and creativity of cooking, but that get pretty buried under it's hyper-sensory reality series excesses. Ramsey has taken this one-note act and spun it into quite a career.

This is not TV for the drive-by viewer looking for something to make them feel good after a day at work. It will be too stressful, too sweat-inducing, too claustrophobic and manipulative. Like any reality show it trusts the audience is stupid and is crammed with unnecessary narration and flashbacks of events we just saw 30 seconds ago. The cooking and elimination action is put together with the ridiculousness of an overblown Michael Bay film, and yet the ""world-is-at-stake"" action movie music and quick cuts to horrified faces doesn't fail to send up a giddy tickle of guilty pleasure entertainment in my belly.

I wouldn't be surprised to see ""Hell's Kitchen"" on a list of the worst shows of the year by the HBO-loving, ""American Idol"" cow-towing media. But I'll take Ramsey's hysterical wrath on inept contestants over reality shows that reach further to mean something any day. This is solid mindless entertainment of the first order.

For me, I am interested to see old items and learn their history, but this show is an anticlimax fest where almost non of the items are real or valuable or even rare. And using items from museums and private collections, it's just pathetic.

Gordon has the right personality to come across very well on TV & this show relies upon that. Ramsey often shows his sense of community service in re-launching these restaurants & promoting them by helping their locale.

FOX has had to tone down the US version from the BBC version. Americans have trouble taking Simon on American Idol & can't take the BBC version of this. I think the FOX version should crank it up to match the British one. I like Ramsey and wish him continued success with this as it is an intelligently done show that gets it viewers interested in good food.

Each week, a designer is eliminated from the competition after exhibiting their work in front of a judges' panel.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437741/?ref_=sr_t_16,1h,Reality-TV,"Nina Garcia,Tim Gunn,Heidi Klum",20.0,293.0,"Project Runway Season 2 bested the first season by bringing us a compelling cast of characters/contestants this time around. First of all, the ""recurring characters"" of Project Runway are attractive and articulate fashion experts whose own careers are well-established enough that they don't need to star in a reality TV show. Host and executive producer Heidi Klum, the supermodel nicknamed ""The Body"", comes across as intelligent and authoritative, even as she tosses each week's loser with a curt ""You're out; auf wiedersehn"" and a kiss on each cheek. Contestants' mentor Tim Gunn, head of Parsons Design School, has the amazing ability of providing feedback to works-in-progress with his wide vocabulary and catch phrases ""Carry on"" and ""Make it work."" Judges Michael Kors, fashion designer, and Nina Garcia, Elle fashion editor, return from last season to cross-examine the contestants. Kors in particular has a biting yet matter-of-fact way of condemning a design.

Sixteen designers dwindle down to a lucky final three who each get the chance to present a collection at Olympus Fashion Week in New York, the climax of the series. The designers compete in a weekly challenge, usually the task of designing a dress around a particular theme or using specific materials under an extremely tight deadline. Each designer has a model who wears the dress on the runway before the judges.

Klum presents each challenge and announces the modest amount of money they have to work with. Gunn checks in on the contestants as they frantically design, sew, and fit the dresses. Contestants also speak directly into the camera in interviews where they discuss their inner thoughts and external conflicts. The completed dresses are modeled on the runway before Klum, Kors, Garcia, and a guest judge (this season's celebrity judges include Badgeley & Mischka, Nicky Hilton, and Iman). The designers with the best and worst designs remain on the runway for questioning by the judges. One by one, designers are asked to leave the runway until the winning and losing designers of that challenge are announced. This selection and elimination process is always handled somewhat differently from one episode to the next, keeping the suspense high for the viewer.

What makes this reality show effectively better than most others is that the contestants MUST have talent and skill to get cast! In Season 2, the designers vary from fresh fashion school graduates Daniel Vosovic and Diana to the older Marla, who already owns her own business. The cast of this season is particularly memorable. My favorite designer to watch is Andrae, a 30-something designer from L.A. with an affected accent, who famously breaks down and cries on the runway.

This season the ""villain"" role played in the first season by Wendy Pepper is the ever-watchable Santino. From his intimidating height to his rude remarks and outlandish designs, Santino elicited gut reactions from the other contestants and had no qualms getting into verbal tussles with the judges.

Some of the challenges from the first season were also re-introduced this time around, such as making a dress from plants and flowers. Some of the challenges were complicated and yet made for great television. For instance, designers were taken off guard when told to design a dress using only the clothes off their back. Another time, designers were given a digital camera and instructed to take pictures, select a single photo, and use it as inspiration for a dress design.

For a reality show in its second season, an element of gimmickry seeped in. Designers were asked to design a dress for My Scene Barbie. They also had to design a dress suitable for the racks of Banana Republic AND design a window display using their live model. Nevertheless each challenge was always rooted in fashion and always fun to watch.

Another attribute of this wonderful series are the strategic decisions made in editing and sound. The original music for the show is catchy and viewers learn to anticipate the cues: this bit of clanging music when we hold our breath before Heidi Klum announces the winner, that bit of sad music when the losing designer walks off the runway with the camera relentlessly following their silhouette as it disappears from view.

Sophisticated reality show viewers now know that behind-the-scenes producer decisions and crafty editing can mislead those trying to guess the winner of an episode or of the series. Project Runway is no exception to these practices. But we don't feel manipulated. At each episode's conclusion, viewers see the winning dress, hear what the designers and judges have to say, and either agree or disagree with the outcome. That's the power of fashion. Someone else may decide what's in or out, but everyone is entitled to keep their own opinion.",

The sharks change from time to time, but the main ones are Robert Herjavec, Daymond John, and Kevin O'Leary. Barbara Corcoran alternates with Lori Greiner as the token woman. Kevin Harrington was an early contributor but lately Mark Cuban has been the 5th member.

Herjavec (1963) is from Canada and made his money in internet security. - John (1969) is from NYC and made his money through FUBU clothing line. - O'Leary (1954) is a Canadian and made his money inventing SoftKey and later The Learning Company. he usually plays ""the bad guy"" - Corcoran (1949) is from New Jersey and made her money in the NYC real estate market - Greiner is called ""The Queen of QVC"" where she created more than 400 products. She is often the ""sweet one"" - Cuban (1958) is from Pittsburg and owns the NBA Dallas Mavericks and Landmark Pictures. - Harrington (1957) is famous for creating the first ""infomercial""


Each episode, guests pitch their products and generally speaking, they are critiqued by the sharks often in a hostile and demeaning manner. That's part of the ""show biz"" flare, but many people will find it objectionable.

As a learning vehicle, the show offers some good examples of how to (and how not to) present their ideas. It's well worth viewing for anyone interested in business and anyone who thinks that at some time they may have to pitch their own ideas.",

One of 50 hopefuls will become a culinary star and one of America's ""Masterchefs.""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1694423/?ref_=sr_t_26,42m,"Game-Show,Reality-TV","Adeline Ramage Rooney,Ben Adler,Robin Ashbrook",14.0,264.0,"I'm very fond of Ramsay's other shows. Gordon's Kitchen Nightmares, Hell's Kitchen, Gordon's Great Escape and more.

There are several issues with this series, and the most significant is that it's US made. Rather inexplicably, all the US versions of said shows are edited in the same, very American and outright dreadful way. There is no difference between episodes or even the shows in that regard. The usual Hollywood narrator quickly gets tiring, there are only a handful of repetitive sound effects which applied to the same moments throughout the show - mostly to combatants' and the judges' reactions to comments and odd behavior. To make things worse, the reactions are also the same. The result watching it is very tiring, like a visual broken record. The cuts are quick and overly dramatic, as if I'm watching a blockbuster action flick. Obviously, I'm not and while some drama is to be expected, the blatant use quickly make the show ridiculous and I feel outright stupid watching poorly seasoned tartar and undercooked chicken in such a dramatic setting. It's so bad it's insulting.

The storyboard is at it's heart not too bad, but it also suffers from repetitiveness. Most of the challenges are the same, albeit set in different environments. They are also linear and not very sporadic which make them predictable. Whenever there's a freestyle cooking challenge, I expect an elimination contest and subsequently a team challenge. Repeat. Masterchef US's storytelling is like Hell's Kitchen US's short menu - scallops or elimination contests, wellington for freestyle cookings and new york strip for team challenges. Really uncooked and lacking in imagination.

The people are portrayed at a fault and their personalities eschewed to create characters that provide intrigues. Some participants are always arrogant, others always cry and some are never recognized by the trio of judges, making this editing going on really easy to spot when a contestant suddenly achieves great respect and skills out of nowhere. The focus of the show is clearly on intrigues when it should be on food and chef skills. In a sense, even the characters are repetitive.

Product placement is also readily apparent. The camera pans across Global knives and Viking appliances, but the most disgusting instances are frequent occurrences where Graham Elliot pitches the apparently new Masterchef pans' non-sticky surfaces. I've seen it at least three times in season two. Same pitch, same lame response from contestants. It's brutal.

I have a lot of issues with this show, but there's one more minor editing problem that just boggles my mind. All the contestants always finish their dishes exactly on the clock. In each competition, Ramsay counts down and they all put their plate on the workbench exactly when the clock stopped. Every. Single. Time! This is to shake things up for the viewer of course, but to think that we're that easily fooled is offensive, just like the rest of the editing problems. Masterchef ridicules itself even further by counting down the last 5 seconds visually on a large clock face to then stop at 00:00. Problem? The units are in minutes and there is no hand for seconds. It looks amusingly stupid.

All the things mentioned above are reflective of each and every episode. Watching two or more in a row is painful. In fact, watching any US remake of Ramsay's program makes for the same experience because of the ubiquitous dreadful editing.

To conclude, the saddest part is that Masterchef is a great concept, executed horribly. Watching unique people of all varieties cook great food to Ramsay's socially inept personality should be a winner for all food lovers. But alas, this show isn't.",

I see reviews where posters say you must be stupid if you are the victim of one of these scams.

The fact remains that people do sometimes invest their emotions in exclusively online relationships.

Online technology is so new and it brings new dimensions in relating to others. One of the most important aspects of online communication is the factor of anonymity. We have all seen the trolls that visit this site and others. We have witnessed the anti-social behavior of some gamers who use their anonymity to escape responsibility for their actions. It should be no surprise that bad behavior can manifest whenever anonymity is part of the formula.

""Catfish"" has shown--unsurprisingly--that the victims are usually people who are emotionally needy, sometimes desperate. The world (real and virtual) is full of people who have trouble fitting in, who are dealing with emotional issues, who have a personal history that makes them vulnerable. They reach out. And sometimes they find an unscrupulous person.

""Catfish"" has also shown that the perpetrators are also damaged people. The first episode of the second season was a prime example. The catfish was someone who had been bullied. She was striking out as a way to make herself feel better.

The human psychology is interesting. These cases serve as warnings for those who might become victims. And the show reminds us that behind all of those anonymous names and avatars exist real people. Every one of them has his own problems. Nev and Max, who are the on-camera hosts, do their best to inject humanity into the proceedings. Their objective is not to ridicule or belittle, unlike some other shows. They attempt to connect with and understand every victim and every catfish.

Surprisingly, the cases they get involved with are very diverse. The catfish might be a lonely person or a scammer. It might be an older lady or a person of an unexpected gender. I don't know how long they can mine this phenomenon, but so far it is entertaining and useful.",

Adam travels the country, in search of eateries, with some of the most mouth-watering cuisine. Adam has a lot of boyish charm, and an engaging sense of fun. Which no-doubt help fuel the amazing popularity, of this show.

The premise of this show, is that Adam accepts 'challenges' to see if he can finish either enormous portions of food, or food that is unbelievably spicy-hot. The catch is, Adam has to finish the food placed before him, within certain time limits-and he does. At least 90% of the time, anyhow.

For example, I've seen Adam put-away some incredibly daunting meals, such as a 72-ounce steak, complete with two side dishes And this was within one hour. Adam has always wolfed-down three dozen oysters, in under 30 minutes, devoured 16 hot dogs in 30 minutes, and blindingly-fiery-hot chicken wings, in 20 minutes.

When Adam says that he's 'just a guy with a serious appetite', he most definitely wasn't kidding! Adam is a big, burly got, but not morbidly obese, as you'd expect of somebody, who eats like Adam does for a living. He also seems to be in surprisingly good physical shape, when he runs around acting exuberant, before each food challenge.

I don't know how Adam can eat so much often greasy, fat-laden food, in one sitting. My guess, is that he starves himself, hours before each challenge. My only beef (no pun intended) with this show, is that the Travel Channnel shows too many re-runs of each episode. It would be nice, if they broadcast new episodes more often.

To me the chief appeal of this program, is that the public can pig-out vicariously, through watching Adam Richman devour so many huge, calorie-laden meals. Once, when he was gorging on a huge hot-fudge Sunday, he said'I know those of you who are watching, are jealous right now'. Most likely, he was right.

When it's ""bad"" it's slightly boring at worst, when it's ""good"" it's freaking epic! For every two or three boring generic make ups on this show there is one awesome one that will make you drop your jaw in amazement. Special mention goes to the Neptune Werewolf, RJ's Lizard Flower, and a majority of makeups that Roy or Eric Fox made.

They are better than all the other ones for one simple reason. This show doesn't go out trying to make things happen just to keep the viewer entertained. TAPS goes out with an objective view to validate their own subjective opinions. If you want to see just the highlights of what they have found, go to the website.

Sure, some episodes come out with nothing at all. But they compliment this with emphasis on genuine character relationships and development (if you watch them in series). Then when you come across some of the episodes where unexplainable (and in some cases unbelievable) things occur, you appreciate them all that more because you know it isn't staged or a hoax. I wish I had the sci-fi channel just for this. I would strongly recommend the DVD's whether your just superstitious or a full fledged hunter yourself.",

And I don't understand why the so called hosts in season one and two are so monotone and awkward. Their delivery is incredibly lame and boring, no personality at all. They are a mess.

Add the insanely frenetic editing, which never focuses on anything for more than a millisecond, and it all adds up to nothing more than a shameful display of product placement.

Because the car you're driving, the car you've spent what seems like a lifetime building and customizing and detailing and injecting, the car you've lived in and on and under every waking hour for as long as you can remember, is only 12.9 seconds away from belonging to someone else. You're a TitleRacer, and you live in a world where a tenth of a second can mean the difference between winning and walking; full throttle is the only gear you've got, and cut throat is the only game you know. TitleRacer is the record-breaking reality series where 6 of the best amateur street racers in the world are pitted against one another in a winner-take-all-single-elimination tournament. The ticket for admission? Their reputations and their rides - both of which they have spent the better part of their adult lives building. One loss, and they surrender their titles to the winning driver who then moves on with one more car and one more week in RacerMansion: a state-of-the-art automotive utopia where every conceivable creature comfort is afforded both car and driver. And to the victors go the spoils. Or the spoiler or the camshaft or the transmission or the engine or anything else the winning drivers see fit to harvest from the cars they win. They can use their race-gotten gain for spare parts to improve their own vehicles, or vice versa, switching rides and salvaging what they want to give their new machines even more muscle than their old ones. The most sadistic of the drivers might just park the cars they've won in the middle of the track ... at a monster truck rally. Or maybe they're curious about how long it takes a Makita UC120DWA electric chainsaw to chew through the chassis of a 2005 Dodge Viper. You want drama? Cut to a close-up of a 28 year old man who has spent the last 7 years of his life building a car that's about to be crushed beneath the 66 inch tires of a truck called GRAVE DIGGER. What drives these adrenaline junkies and what do they drive? We go beyond the track and explore street racing's slick underbelly. Hosted by hip-hop impresario and television/ film actor, Fredro Starr (Torque, Light It Up, Moesha), TitleRacer delves deep into the lives of this millennium's Ben-Hurs: people's champions whose chariots represent the single most important relationship in their lives. Each week features a different type of race: ranging from drifting to drag racing to a 500-mile endurance race during our captivating two-hour season finale. Although the races are controlled for safety, the competitors themselves have an uncontrollable drive to win. In Racer Mansion and on the track, anything can happen; so buckle up and prepare for the race of your life.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0865953/?ref_=sr_t_1142,,,,,,,

Now, it's time to get guys off of the couch and into the weather on TWC's ""Fat Guys in the Woods."" The Weather Channel's Survival Expert, Creek Stewart, will train these men in how to build shelter, start fire and hunt with nothing but their bare hands, and maybe a condom or a gum wrapper. Three men, one week and one objective: to learn the skills that make a man... a man. This show is not about making fun of fat guys. It's about giving regular Joes the chance to do something they've only seen done by Brad Pitt-types. These guys may not have a clue how to survive on their own, but by the end of their week in the woods they'll have the knowledge, and courage, to survive. Creek takes a very simple approach to survival. He says, ""Mother Nature breaks us down to our bare essentials. She reminds us of our most basic human needs and she does not have time for our excuses. We've lost this understanding. We've made everything so complicated. Survival's simple. Don't give up... and don't die."" With that in mind we'll take three men who love their creature comforts, but believe they have the survival instinct to do without them, and test them against the elements. Creek will take the trio into the woods for a week-long immersion into potentially deadly conditions, and learn who does and doesn't have what it takes. With weather as their enemy, everyone will fight to discover their survival instinct, and learn who they really are. Creek is more than up for the challenge of turning these couch potatoes into men. ""I've taught survival for 15 years to people from all walks of life. I don't just teach a skill set, I teach a mind-set. I thrive on seeing that change in people,"" Creek says. With Creek as their guide, can these ""Fat Guys"" conquer mother nature?",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3907378/?ref_=sr_t_1233,,,,,,,

As part of the boy band club, they sang, danced, and for half a decade maintained a stranglehold on their massive and overwhelmingly female audience. But musical trends are fickle and change overnight and the boy band phenomenon couldn't last. Suddenly, a whole generation of former boy band heartthrobs found themselves looking toward life after 'teen idol-dom.' VH1's new series ""Mission: Man Band"" dares to ask the question, ""Can four grown up boy band heartthrobs join forces to capture new fame and fortune?"" Four boy band legends: Chris Kirkpatrick (N*SYNC); Jeff Timmons (98 Degrees); Rich Cronin (LFO) and Bryan Abrams (Color Me Badd) will live together for one month, create new music, a dynamic stage show and perform as a new pop group. Each member of the band finds himself at a different stage in his career. Some are confident, financially comfortable and just looking to make new music. Some have been forced to take a day job and still others may have faced profound life challenges like divorce and illness. Now with 20/20 hindsight, can they avoid the pitfalls of the past? If they are given all of the tools will they let go of old baggage, move forward and make fresh pop magic for a brand new audience? With a second chance at pop-stardom, will these former teen idols be able to transform their destiny or will their egos stand in their way? In the end, we will find out if our boy band alumni are able to recreate the magic that made them stars in the first place. See what happens when all that potentially stands in their way is themselves",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959549/?ref_=sr_t_3024,,,,,,,

Factories mostly employed women - hundreds of thousands of them, who made clothes, telephones and televisions - an amazing array of household items that were sold all over the world. The factories were centred on areas of high unemployment like the south Wales valleys and by employing so many women and girls they were at the forefront of a change in British society. But the women who would drive that change were poorly paid, unfairly treated and denied basic rights. Now, a group of modern-day workers are going back to the shop floor to work in a classic British garment factory to travel through three decades of hard graft and social change to chart just how far women have come. From a mother and her daughters to a young feminist who is the first in her family to go to university, and from a pregnant mother of three to a teenager struggling to find work in the Welsh valleys - how will these 21st-century women adapt to a period of rampant sexism, huge gender pay gaps and tough working conditions?",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8956566/?ref_=sr_t_3144,,,,,,,

A discovery yacht unlike any other. Two helicopters, one submersible and a fleet of zodiacs that run on delivering the in depth exploration. 200 crew. 200 discerning guests. Their lives in the seasoned hands of Captain Erwan Le Rouzic, as he leads all 400 souls on a new journey. A first for the yacht. Together they travel from the relatively safe warm seas of San Diego (USA) to Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica, before reaching the intense ice-cold waters of the Chilean Fjords and Argentina in the preparation for the ultimate expedition to safely explore the final frontier... Antarctica. With 'discovery' embedded into the ship's ethos, Captain Erwan and his team of 30+ different nationalities work 24/7 to fulfill their promise of groundbreaking experiences whilst putting the safety of their guests at the forefront of everything they do. Easier said than done when category 4 hurricanes, extreme seas, severe winds and isolated locations must be navigated. Due to Mother Nature's unpredictability, strict international maritime laws and the intense conditions of the freezing polar region, this journey is anything but smooth sailing for the crew... not that the guests will ever know. Setting a benchmark in ultra-luxury cruising is not a want but a need for the team. That is why Captain Erwan is supported by the elite of the industry. Jason Flesher, Expeditions Operations Director leading the Discovery program and Director of Food and Beverage Chef Tom Goetter fronting culinary. Experienced Cruise Director Amy Kelly and rookie Cruise Director Josh Kelly, in charge of hospitality. Each crew member is the best of the best in their fields. All of them have to be at the top of their game every day, if the ten diverse dining experiences, nine innovative bars and lounges, world class spa, gym and wellness center are all to operate smoothly irrespective of the conditions. But no matter how elite the yacht is and how amazing the staff are, the weather is always the guiding force as Scenic Eclipse forges her way to the coldest and windiest place on earth. An area so remote it is one of only a few in the world where the local animals, such as penguins and whales, don't fear mankind. On any nautical voyage, ego must be set aside and risk must be continually assessed. Especially on a journey as extreme as this route to Antarctica. Discovery is the driver, but guest safety is paramount. The best in the industry know this. The best in the industry live and breathe this. And that is why this crew are among a select few known as Maritime Masters.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27709085/?ref_=sr_t_4017,,,,,,,

 (23)","Oxygen takes viewers to the close-knit Brooklyn community of Bay Ridge, and the adjacent neighborhoods of Coney Island, Brighton Beach, Bensonhurst and Gravesend (where two of the women live), in Oxygen's newest docu-series ""Brooklyn 11223"". The series provides a voyeuristic look into the lives of a group of twentysomething friends whose once rock-solid friendships have been torn apart by betrayal. The borough of Brooklyn provides a scenic and energetic backdrop to an authentic story of friendship, love and family. Much of the activity takes place in the diverse and increasingly affluent, but still traditional, community of Bay Ridge, a destination for many young people in that part of Brooklyn due to its vibrant collection of shops, restaurants, and bars. It is the place where the kids hang out, unwind and where one of the cast members works.

This is shown mostly from the dash cams of the pursuing officers. Although, sometimes they show news clips from helicopters and such. The show consists of two separate people/incidents telling the story. Like all police shows, the perpetrators are always caught.

The competitions the contestants participated in included skydiving, hang gliding, bungee jumping, swimming with sharks, ATV quad-bike racing, jet-skiing, race-car driving, white water rafting, rap jumping and a variety of other dangerous and exciting events. Most of the contestants had never tried any of the extreme sports, and though beginners, had to perform as professionals not only to win the contests, but for their own safety! During each episode, the show also includes a ""Penalty Round"" in which the partners of the losing contestants for that episode get punished! Therefore, if the male of the Red team lost on one day, the female on the Red team was the one that had to do the hardship! These difficult and embarrassing punishments were often performed in public, and truly tested the love and commitment of the couples! However, it also provided more motivation for each contestant to win, so that they didn't have to see their loved ones suffer, or feel their scorn!
